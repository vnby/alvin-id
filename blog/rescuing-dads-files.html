        <p><em>What to do when your computer won't start but your files are still inside</em></p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What Happened</h2>
        <p>My dad's laptop broke. When he turned it on, it would show a blue error screen, then restart, then show the error again — forever. He couldn't use it at all.</p>
        <p>The problem? Three years of important work files were trapped inside.</p>

        <h2>Why This Is Tricky</h2>
        <p>When a laptop won't start properly, you can't just open it and copy your files to a USB drive like you normally would. The computer's brain (the operating system, like Windows) is broken, and it controls everything — including access to your files.</p>
        <p>It's like having a car with a broken ignition. The engine might be fine, and your belongings are still in the trunk, but you can't get to them because the key won't turn.</p>

        <h2>What I Tried (And Why It Didn't Work)</h2>
        <p><strong>Built-in repair tools:</strong> Windows has features to fix itself, but my dad's laptop was too broken for them to work. They kept crashing.</p>
        <p><strong>A different operating system:</strong> I tried using a USB stick with Linux (a free alternative to Windows) to bypass Windows entirely and access the files. But modern laptops have special security features that hide the hard drive from unfamiliar systems. The laptop refused to show me the files.</p>
        <p><strong>Reinstalling Windows:</strong> I tried to install a fresh copy of Windows, thinking I could then access the old files. But the same security features blocked the installation program.</p>

        <h2>What Finally Worked</h2>
        <p>I used a simple trick: instead of trying to <em>install</em> Windows from the USB stick, I used the USB just to <em>start up</em> a mini version of Windows temporarily.</p>
        <p>Think of it like this: if your car's ignition is broken, you might be able to use a mechanic's diagnostic tool to at least unlock the doors and get your belongings out — even if you can't drive anywhere.</p>
        <p>From this temporary Windows environment, I was able to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Access my dad's hard drive</li>
          <li>Plug in an external drive</li>
          <li>Copy all his important files</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>It took less than five minutes once I figured out the right approach.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Surprise: Secret Encryption</h2>
        <p>Here's something I didn't know: Windows had secretly <em>encrypted</em> (scrambled) my dad's files to protect them from thieves. This is actually a good security feature — if someone steals your laptop, they can't read your files.</p>
        <p>But it caused problems for me. When I tried to access the files using Linux, they were locked and I didn't have the password.</p>
        <p>Luckily, the laptop has a special security chip that remembers my dad's laptop specifically. When I used the Windows USB stick on <em>his</em> laptop, the chip recognized it was legitimate and automatically unlocked the files. This only worked because I was using his original laptop — it wouldn't have worked on any other computer.</p>

        <h2>Lessons for Everyone</h2>

        <h3>1. Always have backups</h3>
        <p>Don't keep your only copy of important files on one device. Use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An external hard drive</li>
          <li>Cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive)</li>
          <li>Both!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Know that your files might be secretly encrypted</h3>
        <p>Windows 11 often turns on encryption automatically. This is good for security, but it means you should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a Microsoft account (so your unlock key is saved online), OR</li>
          <li>Back up your unlock key somewhere safe</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Keep a Windows USB stick ready</h3>
        <p>A USB stick with Windows on it costs nothing to create and can save you in emergencies. If you have a tech-savvy friend or family member, ask them to make one for you.</p>

        <h3>4. Don't panic — files are often recoverable</h3>
        <p>When a laptop "dies," it's usually the software that's broken, not the actual storage. Your files are probably still there. A professional or knowledgeable friend can often recover them.</p>

        <h2>The Happy Ending</h2>
        <p>My dad's files — three years of work documents — are now safely copied to an external drive.</p>
        <p>The laptop is still broken. We might fix it later, or get a new one. But the important thing is: <strong>the files are safe</strong>.</p>
        <p>That was the only goal that really mattered.</p>
