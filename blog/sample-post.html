      <h1>Lessons from Five Years of Product Management</h1>
      <div class="post-meta">January 15, 2025</div>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Five years ago, I stepped into my first product management role with a head full of frameworks and very little practical wisdom. Half a decade later, I've shipped features that moved metrics, killed features that didn't, and learned more from failures than successes.</p>

        <p>Here are some of the things I wish someone had told me on day one.</p>

        <h2>The roadmap is a conversation, not a contract</h2>

        <p>Early on, I treated the product roadmap like a sacred document. Every item had to be delivered on time, in scope, exactly as described. It took me a while to understand that a roadmap is really a communication tool &mdash; a way to align stakeholders around direction, not a promise of specific deliverables on specific dates.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The best roadmaps are living documents that evolve as you learn more about your users and your market.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Data informs, but doesn't decide</h2>

        <p>I'm a firm believer in data-driven decision making. But "data-driven" doesn't mean "data-dictated." There are always qualitative factors &mdash; user sentiment, market timing, strategic bets &mdash; that numbers alone can't capture. The skill is knowing when to trust the data and when to trust your judgment.</p>

        <h2>Stakeholder management is product management</h2>

        <p>If you can't get buy-in from engineering, design, leadership, and business teams, even the best product ideas will die on the vine. I've learned that the time spent building relationships, communicating context, and creating shared understanding is never wasted. It's the foundation everything else is built on.</p>

        <h2>Ship, learn, iterate</h2>

        <p>Perfectionism is the enemy of progress. Some of the most impactful things I've shipped were scrappy first versions that we refined over time based on real user feedback. The goal isn't to ship something perfect &mdash; it's to ship something that lets you learn.</p>

        <p>Five years in, I'm still learning. And I think that's the point.</p>
